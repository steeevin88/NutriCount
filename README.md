# NutriCount
Web application made as part of Santa Clara University's 10th Hack for Humanity hackathon (2023).
## Inspiration
Tracking calories is pivotal for individuals trying to build and maintain proper physical health; however, popular calorie tracking applications are frequently, if not always surrounded by a form of subscription or membership, resulting in inconveniences for a simple task.
## What it does
This application allows individuals to swiftly input their calorie intake separated by common food categories, providing users with a simple calorie tracker, visuals breaking down an individual's caloric diversity, and a "health rating" based on inputted diets.
## How we built it
We used HTML, CSS, Bulma (CSS framework), and Javascript.
## Challenges we ran into
As first-year engineering majors, many of us had never touched web development so simply getting everyone started and on the same page was a long process.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're proud to have a working calorie tracker with our own art, designs, and visuals (charts).
